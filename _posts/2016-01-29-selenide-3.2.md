Good morning!

We released Selenide 3.2

## Now Selenide logs browser version

We added INFO log containing version of browser, Selenium and Selenide:

```
00:32:45 INFO BrowserName=chrome Version=48.0.2564.109 Platform=MAC
00:32:45 INFO Selenide v. 3.2
00:32:45 INFO Selenium WebDriver v. 2.51.0 build time: 2016-02-05 11:20:57
```

## Better report

We renamed FAILED->FAIL, PASSED->PASS in selenide report. So they don't mess with `PASSED` and `FAILED` that are typically
written by Maven and other tools.
Now it's a little bit easier to analyze Selenide output in Jenkins.


## Added method for selecting option by index

Before Selenide 3.2 you could select an option by text or value:

```java
    $("select#email").selectOption("@gmail.com");
    $("select#email").selectOptionByValue("98347643");
```

Now you can also [select option by index](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/275):
```java
    $("select#email").selectOption(4);
```


## Added setting `selenide.browser-size`

Now you can set [browser size](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/272) before running tests:
 
```bash
java -Dselenide.browser-size=1024x768
```

or directly in code:

```java
@Before
public void setUp() {
  Configuration.browser = "chrome";
  Configuration.browserSize = "1024x768";
}
```

It's probably a good idea to declare a (minimal) expected browser size supported by the application in test.
So your tests will verify that the application works on that small displays.

## Upgraded to selenium-java 2.50.0

See [selenium 2.50.0 changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/master/java/CHANGELOG).

Good evening!

Good new year news: we released Selenide 3.1. 

## Updated documentation

We fixed and updated [documentation](/documentation.html) on site.

Thanks to [Aleksei Vinogradov](https://github.com/vinogradoff) and Erik Khalimov for hard work!


## Method `$().download()` does not allow invisible links

Before Selenide 3.1, method `$().download()` allowed to download fils from invisible links.
We fixed this [bug](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/263). 
Thanks to [@dimand58](https://github.com/dimand58) for this [pull request](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/264). 

## Methods `switchTo(...)` now can wait if needed

Methods `switchTo(alert())`, `switchTo(frame())`, `switchTo(window())` got smarter. Now they can wait a little bit, if 
[alert](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/206), [frame](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/206) 
or [window](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/271) is not loaded yet. As usually, default timeout is 4 seconds. 

## Added methods `byName`, `byXpath`, `byLinkText`, `byPartialLinkText`, `byId` 

These are new static methods in class `Selectors` (where methods `byText` and `withText` were).
Actually they are just aliases for selenium built-in `By.*` methods.
I am not sure they are really useful, but some folks like the idea of not using any Selenium classes in their tests.
Also it was needed for folks who use Selenide in their .NET tests. Imagine, people!

## Condition`$.shouldHave(exactTextCaseSensitive("..."))` checks the entire string

Before Selenide 3.1 it checks only a substring. We fixed this bug.

## Methods `$(WebElement, selector)` and `$$(WebElement, selector)` marked as deprecated

It's recommended to use method `find` instead:

 * `$(WebElement).find(selector)`
 * `$$(WebElement).find(selector)`

## Added method `$.getValue()`

Actually this is just an alias for `$.val()`.

## Selenide includes phantomjsdriver 1.2.1 out of the box

Now you don't need to include additional dependencies to use PhantomJS in your tests.

## Upgraded to selenium-java 2.49.0

See [selenium 2.49.0 changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/master/java/CHANGELOG).

See you!
Selenide 3.2 and 3.3 is coming soon!

Good morning!
We released Selenide 2.24. It's a minor release.

## Upgraded to selenium-java 2.48.2

[changelog of selenium 2.48.2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/master/java/CHANGELOG).

## Add method `$.pressEscape()`

In addition to methods  

```java
$("input").pressEnter();
$("input").pressTab();
```

we have now new method:

```java
$("input").pressEscape();
```

## Fixed soft asserts for TestNG

As you probably know Selenide has [soft asserts](http://ru.selenide.org/2015/05/05/selenide-2.16-and-2.17/) functionality.
Some time ago it was broken if you run tests in TestNG. Now we fixed it. 

## Logic of webdriver creation extracted to a separate class WebDriverFactory

Before this release, class `WebDriverRunner` created browsers. But it grew to be too large: it also detects hanging 
browsers, closes and reopens browsers etc. That's why we extracted logic of **creating** webdrivers to a separate class.

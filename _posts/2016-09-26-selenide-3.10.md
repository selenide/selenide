Hi!

We released Selenide 3.10! 

## Proxy server is disabled by default

It's 
I am sad to say this, but it seems that the experiment with a proxy server has not yet succeeded.

There is a problem with the "new way" of downloading files using Selenide built-in proxy server.
It works for all my projects, but some folks reported that it doesn't work for them.
I still don't know exactly the problem and its causes. 
Probably those who use Selenium Grid experience this problem.

Anyway, now [we reverted](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/402) default downloading mechanism to `HTTPGET`.
If you need to use proxy server, enable it via system property:

```
-Dselenide.fileDownload=PROXY
```

Or directly in your code:

```java
Configuration.fileDownload = PROXY;
```

By the way, we fixed [issue 393](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/393): 
Selenide will not even try to run proxy server until `fileDownload=PROXY` is set.

## Added support for multiple selects

There are dropdown lists that allowing selecting multiple options (`<select multiple>`).
Now it's easy to select multiple options in Selenide with just one command:


```java
select.selectOption("Margarita", "Theodor Woland");  // by test
select.selectOption(0, 2, 3);                        // by index
select.selectOptionByValue("cat", "woland");         // by value
```

We also added a method for getting all selected options:

```java
select.getSelectedOptions().shouldHave(texts("Margarita", "Theodor Woland"));
```

## Now you can print report only for failed tests

As you probably know, in Selenide you can print [report of all executed steps ](http://selenide.org/2015/11/30/selenide-2.25).

Now you can configure if it should be printed only for failed tests. Or only for succeeded tests. Or always.

For JUnit:
 
```java
   @Rule
   public TestRule report = new TextReport().onFailedTest(true).onSucceededTest(false);
```
 
For TestNG:
 
```java
  @Listeners(TextReport.class)
  public class GoogleTestNGTest {
    @BeforeMethod
    public void setUp() {
      TextReport.onSucceededTest = false;
      TextReport.onFailedTest = true;
    }
  }
```

## Fixed bug with parsing http header `Content-Disposition` containing encoding

Now Selenide uses correct file name even if header `Content-Disposition` contains encoding:

```
Content-Disposition: filename=Prices.csv;charset=UTF-8
```

See. [issue 398](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/398)


## Fixed bug 401: "Selenide swallows exception in some cases"

Never ever write `catch (Throwable)`. Never!

See. [issue 401](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/401)

## Method `open(url)` now works for URL in upper case

It's weird, but sometimes people want to enter url in upper case. 
And they found that Selenide could not open such urls. Ups.  

Now we fixed it: [issue 407](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/407)

## Uncommented one old test

See. [issue 379](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/379)

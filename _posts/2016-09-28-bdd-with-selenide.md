Hi!

People often ask if they can use BDD with Selenide.

Short answer: Yes, you can!

There is plenty of BDD tools in Java and Python. You can use any of them with Selenide.
Some working examples:
Selenide + Cucumber: 
https://github.com/selenide-examples/cucumber/tree/master/src/test/resources/org/selenide/examples/cucumber

Selenide + JBehave:
https://gist.github.com/mp911de/009ea539271da0633c59

Selenide + GEB: 
https://github.com/selenide-examples/geb-maven-tutorial/blob/master/src/test/groovy/stepdefs/IndexStepDefs.groovy

Selenide + Gauge:
https://github.com/selenide-examples/GaugeSelenideExample/blob/master/specs/example.spec
You can find a whole book here full of examples with Selenide, JBehave and Cucumber:

P.S. I personally don't value BDD really much. I think it's a nice idea, but it doesn't really work. Business stakeholders do not really write executable specifications.

Good day!

In the last day of spring, we released Selenide 3.6. 

## Reverted page loading strategy to `normal`
 
In Selenide 3.5 we set default page loading strategy to `none`. 
It made tests faster for some users, but other users complained that it broke their tests,
so that they had to rollback to Selenide 3.4.

Now the default page loading strategy is again `normal` (it's Selenium default).
If you want to speed up your tests, just configure 

```bash
-Dselenide.page-load-strategy=none
```

or

```java
Configuration.pageLoadStrategy = "none";
```

See [issue #321](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/321)

## Now page objects don't have to be public 

... or have public constructor. 

```java
public class GoogleSearchTest {
    private SearchPage search;

    private static class SearchPage {
      public ResultsPage searchFor(String keyword) {
        $(By.name("q")).val(keyword).pressEnter();
        return page(ResultsPage.class);
      }
    }
}
```

Make it private. Remove useless constructors. Clean up your code. 

See [issue #335](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/335)

## Added support for JBrowser webdriver 
  
JBrowser is a new headless browser (like HtmlUnit and PhantomJS). 
In theory, it could be faster than usual browsers.
In practice, JBrowser seems to be unusable yet: most of Selenide own tests fail with it.
 
But you can try it by yourself: `-Dselenide.browser="jbrowser"`.

And you will need to add dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency org="com.machinepublishers" name="jbrowserdriver" rev="[0.13.0, 2.0)" conf="test-default"/>
```

## Method $().download() now uses the standard selenide timeout

Before this change, method `$.download()` could hang sometimes.
Now it works no longer that 4 seconds (or whatever timeout you configured). 

See [issue #341](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/341)

## Added support for Basic Auth for all common browsers

You can find usage examples [here](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/blob/master/src/test/java/integration/BasicAuthTest.java):

```java
Selenide.open("http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd",
        "",
        "user",
        "passwd");
```

See [issue #320](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/320)

Thanks to [dimand58](https://github.com/dimand58) for this pull request!

## Added method `$.screenshotAsImage()`

It allows to get an image of some element.
It may be useful for debugging, especially when the page is large, and all elements do not fit on the screen.

```java
BufferedImage elementScreenshot = $(".logo").screenshotAsImage();
```

## Fixed TestNG TextReport Listener

now the report will only be generated for classes annotated with `@Report`.

If I understand correctly, it is a TestNG: if listener is declared in one of test classes, it's applied to all tests. Like this:

```
@Listeners(TextReport.class)
```

It may be a problem if you want to generate a report only for some problematic tests.

Now we fixed it. The report will not be generated for all test classes, but only those annotated with `@Report`. 

Thanks to [Alexei Vinogradov](https://github.com/vinogradoff) for his work on TestNG listeners!


## Upgraded phantomjsdriver to version 1.3.0 (compatible with selenium-java 2.53.0)

Unfortunately, PhantomJS Driver project has been asleep for a while. 
Its original author Ivan Marino declared that he cannot support the project anymore. :(

That's why we [forked](https://github.com/codeborne/ghostdriver) it and released phantomjsdriver 1.3.0, 
that is compatible with the latest Selenium Webdriver 2.53.0. 
And now this version is included with Selenide 3.6+. 

<br/>

That's all about Selenide 3.6. 

Download and test with pleasure!

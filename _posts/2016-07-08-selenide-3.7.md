Hi all!

We released Selenide 3.7! 

## Upgraded to Selenium 2.53.1

It should fix the problem with Firefox 47.

## Added support for Marionette browser

To run your tests with Marionette browser, you can set parameter in command line (or build script):

```
-Dselenide.browser=marionette
```

or set browser directly in your tests:

```java
  Configuration.browser = "marionette";
```

see. [pull request #349](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/349)

Thanks to [Geroen Dierckx](https://github.com/ridiekel) for this pull request!


## Added support for non-web drivers

There are some "webdrivers" that do not actually drive web-browsers, but
 
* native Windows applications ([Winium](https://github.com/2gis/Winium)),
* Java Swing applications ([Marathon](https://marathontesting.com/seleniumwebdriver-bindings/)),
* and even mobile applications ([Appium](http://appium.io/)). 

Naturally, these drivers do not support JavaScript. 
It appeared that Selenide could not work without JavaScript. 

In Selenide 3.7, we have fixed this problem. Now Selenide should work with non-web drivers.

see. [issue #345](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/345)

## Removed useless message `Screenshots: ` if screenshots are disabled

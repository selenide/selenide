Good night!

We released Selenide 3.8! It fixes some small issues and introduces small but useful features. 

<br/>

### Fixed file uploading on remote browsers in Grid

Thanks to [Alexei Vinogradov](https://github.com/vinogradoff) for fixing remote upload!

### Now you can disable automatic creating of *.html files

When your test fails, Selenide automatically saves 2 files:

1. Screenshot - *.png file
2. Page source code - *.html file
 
But sometimes people don't want to save *.html files. For example, in case of 
single page application the page source contains html code of all application pages. Thus it's too big and useless.

Now you can disable saving html files. As usually, via system property:

```bash
  mvn test -Dselenide.savePageSource=false
```

or directly in your code:

```java
  Configuration.savePageSource = false;
```

Thanks to [Boris Osipov](https://github.com/BorisOsipov) for this [pull request](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/359)!

### Added method `$.dragAndDropTo(WebElement)`

Until now, Selenide had only method `$.dragAndDropTo(String)`,
where string parameter is CSS selector of target element. 
But sometimes you want to define target element in another way. 

Now you can use the new method `$.dragAndDropTo(WebElement)`. For example:

```java
  SelenideElement target = $(byText("Drop here"));
  $("#from").dragAndDropTo(target);
```

See [issue #355](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/355)

### Now TestNG annotations `SimpleReport` and `SoftAsserts` are thread-safe

If you use annotations `SimpleReport` or `SoftAsserts` and TestNG framework,
and run tests in parallel, you could see an empty report sometimes. 
Or you could get `ConcurrentModificationException` time-to-time.

It appeared that TestNG is bad boy. Just bad. 
If you declare `@Listener(SoftAsserts)` for **one** test class, TestNG 
creates a single instance of `SoftAsserts` and uses for **ALL** tests (even parallel).

> As opposite, JUnit is cool guy. It creates a new instance of every test class and every Rule
before running every next test method. Thus it avoids dependencies between tests and
random failures because of previous tests. 

We have fixed this problem. Now `SoftAsserts` listener can work in several parallel threads. 
Even in TestNG. 

See issues [#364](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/364) and 
[#303](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/303).

# Added new methods to class `Selectors`: `byCssSelector()` and `byClassName()`

I am still not sure that it's really needed, but people asked for it many times.
No `Selectors` has `by*` analogues for all selenium `By.*` methods.

See [issue #360](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/360).

### Fixed JavaScript error when running Edge browser

Now you can run your Selenide tests with the new Microsoft browser Edge.
People say it should be quite fast.  

See [issue #339](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/339).

### Now method `$.screenshot()` saves screenshots in a right place

Selenide has method for saving screenshot of a single element (not a whole page):

```java
  String screenshotFile = $("#footer").screenshot();
```

The problem is that this method saved screenshot to the project root.
Now it's fixed, and saves screenshot to the right place - `build/reports` by default.

See [issue #290](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/290).

### Added protection against invalid soft asserts usages 

Now Selenide will throw an exception if you enable "Soft asserts" mode,
but forget to add `SoftAssert` annotation to your test classes.

See [issue #302](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/302).

### We added link to implementation to all `SelenideElement` methods' javadoc

For example, method [$("input").setValue("hello")](http://selenide.org/javadoc/3.8/com/codeborne/selenide/SelenideElement.html#setValue-java.lang.String-)
is actually implemented in class [`SetValue`](http://selenide.org/javadoc/3.8/com/codeborne/selenide/commands/SetValue.html)

See [issue #367](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/367).

### Upgraded to htmlunit 2.23

See htmlunit [release notes](http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#a2.23)

### For dessert

And for dessert - a fresh joke about Chuck Norris:

> Chuck Norris does not use Selenide.<br/>
> Chuck Norris writes tests in pure Selenium webdriver.<br/>
> Chuck Norris is immortal - he has enough time for this.

Let's upgrade!

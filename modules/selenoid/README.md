Selenide Selenoid plugin
================================

A [Selenide](https://selenide.org) extension for working with Selenoid.

# Deprecation notice

[Selenoid](https://github.com/aerokube/selenoid) project is not supported anymore. 
So `selenide-selenoid` plugin is also deprecated. 
You can use `selenide-moon` or `selenide-grid` instead. 

Or even better, just run the browser locally (on the same machine with test). It's the fastest and stablest way.

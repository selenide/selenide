* Deprecated `$(WebElement,...) $$(WebElement,..)` - use ``$(WebElement).$(...) instead
* Added `getValue` method for SelenideElement (the same as `val()`)
* Upgraded to selenium-java 2.49.0, [changelog](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/java/CHANGELOG)

## 3.0 (Released 24.12.2015)

### New functions:

* Add method Selenide.updateHash() (thanks to @fabienbancharel for pull request #254)
* upgrade to sizzle 2.2.1
* upgrade to guava 19.0
* upgrade to testng 6.9.10

### Big refactoring:

* Refactor AbstractSelenideElement. Instead of single huge class, it's split to many small classes ("commands").
* User can override any of these commands
* User can add any custom commands to the standard Selenide methods

### Code cleanup:

* Remove deprecated conditions:
  * `notPresent` -> Use method `$.shouldNot(exist)` or `$.shouldNotBe(present)`.
  * `hasOptions` -> Not needed anymore. Use methods `$.selectOption()` or `$.selectOptionByValue()`.
  * `options` -> Not needed anymore. Use methods `$.selectOption()` or `$.selectOptionByValue()`.
  * `hasNotClass` -> Use method `$.shouldNotHave(cssClass("abc"))`
* Remove deprecated class JQuery
* Remove deprecated class PrettyReportCreator (use class `TextReport` for JUnit or TestNG)
* Remove deprecated methods
  * `Selenide.switchToWindow(title)` -> use method `switchTo().window(title)`
  * `Selenide.switchToWindow(index)` -> use method `switchTo().window(index)`
* Remove deprecated methods
  * `WebDriverRunner.ie()` -> use method `WebDriverRunner.isIE()`
  * `WebDriverRunner.htmlUnit()` -> use method `WebDriverRunner.isHtmlUnit()`
  * `WebDriverRunner.phantomjs()` -> use method `WebDriverRunner.isPhantomjs()`
  * `WebDriverRunner.takeScreenShot()` -> use method `Screenshots.takeScreenShot()`
* Remove deprecated methods
  * `$.should*(String message, Condition condition)` -> use method `$.should*(condition.because(message))`
* Remove class com.codeborne.selenide.impl.Quotes
  because it was migrated to Selenium Webdriver (org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Quotes)

* Method savePageSourceToFile tries to close unexpected alert/confirm dialog (if any)
* Upgraded to Selenium 2.41.0

## 2.9 (Released 14.03.2014)

## 2.8 (Released 15.02.2014)

### Non-backward compatible changes:

* See #96 Method `WebDriverRunner.setWebDriver()` does not close previous webdriver. You are responsible for webdriver lifecycle if you are using setWebDriver().
* See #63 Method `Condition.actualValue()` is optional (it's not needed in most cases). It makes creating custom conditions even easier.

### Improvements:

* See #95 #79 - Selenide automatically takes screenshots on any test failure, not only if `$.shouldXXX` method fails.
* Un-deprecated WebDriverProvider. It still can be useful.
* See #89 Do not exclude cglib dependency - it's needed for taking screenshots with RemoteWebDriver

### New features:

* Method `executeJavaScript()` can accept multiple arguments

## 2.7 (Released 31.12.2013)

* See #59 Automatically take screenshot on any failures. More exactly, when any of methods `$.shouldXXX(condition)` fails.
* See #59 When running tests in Jenkins, Selenide shows public URL of screenshots 
  (using BUILD_URL variable provided by Jenkins).
  It's incredibly convenient because you can watch screenshots right in the Jenkins report.
* See #59 Added method getScreenshots() for retrieving all taken screenshots
* Upgraded to Selenium 2.39.0

## 2.6.1 (Released 29.11.2013)

* The most wanted feature is finally here!
  Added method `$.download()` for downloading file by "href" attribute!

## 2.6 (Released 26.11.2013)

* Added method $.scrollTo()

## 2.5 (Released 11.11.2013)

* Better support for `PhantomJS`: ignore alerts and confirms
* All webdrivers accept SSL certificates by default
* Selenide clearly says if timeout is mistakenly given in seconds instead of milliseconds.
* Condition constructor has been simplified (for easier creation of custom conditions)
* Upgraded to Selenium 2.37.1

## 2.4 (Released 16.09.2013)

* CollectionCondition#texts matches substrings
* Added method CollectionCondition#exactTexts
* Maximize PhantomJS driver "window" by default
* Better error messages for wrapped elements in PageObjects

### Bugfixes:

* Method `$$.findBy` waits until element matches the condition
* Method `$.append()` first waits until element gets visible

### Technical issues:

* Updated to selenium-java:2.35.0
* Moved implementation details from WebDriverRunner class to separate WebDriverThreadLocalContainer, ScreenShotLaboratory and Cleanup classes that are not static and can be overridden if needed.
* WebDriverProvider is deprecated

## 2.3 (Released 9.07.2013)

### New features:

* Added possibility to mock 'alert' and 'confirm' modal dialogs
* $$.should-methods can check multiple conditions
* Collection methods can be chained:
 $$("#multirowTable tr").shouldHave(size(2))
    .filterBy(text("Norris")).shouldHave(size(1));

### Usability issues:

* Readable error messages!
* Save screenshots into subfolders: folder name is "com/package/TestClass/", file name is "testName.png"/"testName.html"
* Take screenshots for RemoteWebDriver too (using Augmenter)
* Added javadoc for all SelenideElement methods

### Technical issues:

* Updated to selenium-java:2.33.0
* Use "webdriver.quite()" instead of "webdriver.close()" to force closing ChromeDriver and IE process
* Fixed XPath for byText and withText
* Removed using INTRODUCE_FLAKINESS_BY_IGNORING_SECURITY_DOMAINS for IE driver as it seems to be a bad practice

* Added method `$$.shouldHave(texts("A", "B", "C"))` for asserting texts of all matching elements
* Added method `$.data(attr)` as a synonym for `$.getAttribute("data-" + attr)`
* Added conditions "name", "not", "type", "id": `$("#username").shouldHave(name("firstName"))`
* text and exactText conditions are case-insensitive (reason - in css designer can apply text transformations and tests will fail)
* introduced `textCaseSensitive` and `exactTextCaseSensitive` conditions
* added open methods to Selenide class that return page object by class
* Methods `$.selectOption` and `$.selectOptionByValue` trigger change event when possible.
* Class ElementsCollection now contains list of SelenideElements (instead of WebElements).
* Removed deprecated condition "haveText". Use `$.shouldHave(text("john"))` instead.
* Excluded org.webbit, netty, selenium-iphone-driver, selenium-safari-driver from Selenide dependencies to avoid loading too much useless stuff unless it's really needed.
* Now Condition implements Predicate<WebElement>. So it can be used for filtering collections.

## 2.0 (Released 3.03.2013)

* Drop deprecated classes and methods (DOM, Navigation).
* Updated to selenium-java:2.31.0
* Selenide 2.0 is not backward-compatible with Selenide 1.+
  Migration guide:

## 1.11 (Released 28.02.2013)

* Method $.setValue() triggers onchange event with standard JavaScript instead of jQuery.
* Condition "empty" checks for both text and value.
* Added condition "exactText".

* Added selector "by" as a synonym for "byAttribute"
* Updated to selenium-java:2.30.0

## 1.10 (Released 11.02.2013)

* Methods assertElement, assertVisible, assertHidden in DOM are deprecated.
* Renamed ShouldableWebElement to SelenideElement (shouldable still exists for compatibility)
* $$ does not implement WebElement anymore - it was useless feature.
* Now Selenide kills webdriver if it failed to close normally
* Moved useful methods to class Selenide. Class DOM will be marked as deprecated in version 1.11 and dropped in 2.0
* Updated to selenium-java:2.29.1

## 1.9 (Released 5.01.2013)

* No need for waitFor/waitUntil methods. All the $(), getElement() and shouldXXX() methods wait for a few seconds until element appears or condition gets satisfied.
* Added support for PageObjects - see method DOM.page(Class)
* Added methods $().find() with index parameter
